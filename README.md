The district schools seem to perform worse than charter schools in both reading and math (when considering average scores and/or percent of students passing each). District schools have an average of 53.67% of students passing overall. This is likely attributed to the lack of students passing math as disticts school's have an average of 66.55% of students passing math, compared to charter schools that have an average of 93.62% passing math.
