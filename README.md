School Type Analysis

The district schools seem to perform worse than charter schools in both reading and math (when considering average scores and/or percent of students passing each). District schools have an average of 53.67% of students passing overall. This is likely attributed to the lack of students passing math as disticts school's have an average of 66.55% of students passing math, compared to charter schools that have an average of 93.62% passing math.

Considering Grades and Number of Students

The impact of the school type on math grades becomes more apparent when examining both math scores for each grade. The average scores across grades are fairly consistent implying that regardless of grade level, district schools struggle more to pass scales. However district schools on average have 3,854 students while charter schools only have 1,524 students on average. While looking at the total count of students at each school is a good starting point for this analysis, it might be more useful to investigate average class sizes instead of the total count of students.
